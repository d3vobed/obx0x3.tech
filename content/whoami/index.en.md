I am a former cyberdefense student at ENSIBS and former pentester for AlgoSecure. My favorite categories are **OSINT**, **pentest**, **forensics** and **malware analysis**.

### üíª Infosec, or about 80% of my life
Being passionate about computer security, I practice during my free time various activities in the field. I'm founder and a member of the [MILF](https://milfctf.com/) (*Mother I'd Like to Flag*) CTF Team. We participate in various CTFs throughout the year wether they are online or on-site. 

Apart from CTF, I like to practice on various infosec learning platforms such as TryHackMe or HackTheBox.

### ü™ü Life outside of infosec, the last 20%
Outside of cybersecurity, I am also passionate about other things. I'm interested in motorsports as a whole. In fact, I often take part in rides or gatherings between fans of this discipline. 

I'm also passionate about Japan. By the way, I had the opportunity to travel and work there for 2 months during summer 2022. Indeed, as part of the engineering degree, it is necessary to spend a minimum of **8 weeks** abroad.

Finally, space is a field in which I've always been fascinated by. That said, I wasn't that good in high school when it came to solving physics equations. :P

### ‚ú® Future plans
I plan to pursue in the field of digital forensics and incident response. My goal, as big as it may be, is to drive science forward, and more specifically the field of cyberdefense by contributing to the community and improve IT security.

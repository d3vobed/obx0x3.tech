### Cybersecurity, satellites and eavesdropping
*(Sep. 2022 to Feb. 2023)*

The project is a research project. At the end, the main objective is to help secure satellite communications. This project was divided into two main objectives:
- Vulnerability research on protocols used in satellite communications
- Setting up a satellite simulator to test our proof of concepts.

Personally, I wanted to work on this project to discover the topic of cybersecurity applied to space in order to gain knowledge and get out of my comfort zone. But also because space is a domain I find fascinating.
